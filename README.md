# DMScreenReact
A simple dm toolkit made in react. This toolkit is meant to be a type of digital DM screen with tools that would be helpfull when dming D&D 5th addition. But some of the features would be usefull in any table top roleplaying system.

#### Features I want to include
##### Not all of these will make it but I just want to get all my ideas out
1: List of all conditions and their descriptions

2: Random npc name generator, and a random race, age, and gender.

3: Random encounter tables (and the ability to select what region to get encounters from)

4: Difficulty class guide (tells you what to set the dc based on how hard the action is

5: Random shop/tavern names

6: Random loot tables or magic items based on rarity

7: Customization?
