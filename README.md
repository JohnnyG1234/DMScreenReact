# DMScreenReact
A simple dm toolkit made in react. This toolkit is meant to be a type of digital DM screen with tools that would be helpfull when dming D&D 5th addition. But some of the features would be usefull in any table top roleplaying system.

## Features

1: List of all conditions and their descriptions

2: Random npc generator

3: Random encounter generator (and the ability to select what region to get encounters from)

4: Difficulty class guide (tells you what to set the dc based on how hard the action is)

5: Random tavern

6: Random loot selector based on monster

## Context

I made this for one of my college courses and the idea behind it was to make some sort of react website for my portfolio. I choose to make a DM screen type tool as it is something I'm interested in, and I think it would be usefull to a DM new to the game. 

Feel free the use of the code here and change it around how ever you like. If you just want to use it I'm currently working on a way to get it hosted somewhere!

## Sources
I used a ton of sources to help me make this website, and to grab data to actually use on it, a list of everything I used can be found in Documentation/Sources.txt but I'll list the highlights here.

### W3 Schools
I love this website, it has great guides on pretty much every tech related topic you could think of and I used it countless times in this project.

### Chartopia
This is a website where you can create random tables for any table top game, but it also has an api where you can pull data from *ANY* public table. I used it to get random loot, npcs, and taverns.

To learn react I first followed this tutorial made by Jad Joubran and I would highly recomend it to anyone wanting to learn react.
