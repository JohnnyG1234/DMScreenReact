# DMScreenReact
A simple dm toolkit made in react. This toolkit is meant to be a type of digital DM screen with tools that would be helpfull when dming D&D 5th addition. But some of the features would be usefull in any table top roleplaying system.

## Features

1: List of all conditions and their descriptions

2: Random npc generator

3: Random encounter generator (and the ability to select what region to get encounters from)

4: Difficulty class guide (tells you what to set the dc based on how hard the action is

5: Random tavern

6: Random loot selector based on monster

## Context

I made this for one of my college courses and the idea behind it was to make some sort of react website for my portfolio. I choose to make a DM screen type tool as it is something I'm interested in, and I think it would be usefull to a DM new to the game. 

Feel free the use of the code here and change it around how ever you like. If you just want to use it I'm currently working on a way to get it hosted somewhere!
